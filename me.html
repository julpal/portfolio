<div class="about">
        <h2>about me.</h2>
        <p>I am a student <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/"> @umsi</a> studying UX Design. I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.annarbor.org/"> Ann Arbor</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I began college with a passion for studying human behavior. Along the way, I picked up a love for design and technology. I am focused on working with users to create experiences that work for everyone. Inclusivity is very important to me as a human and designer. My goal is to spend every day learning and becoming better.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>a few things that make me smile.</h2>
        <h3>traveling.</h3> <p>What is life but beautiful experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>film.</h3> <p>My favorite art medium. The story, the shots, the performaces... it all inspires me.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>cooking.</h3> <p>Intuitive eating has become extremely important to me. Your life changes when you listen to your body.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>fitness.</h3> <p>I used to think people who enjoyed the gym were silly, but here I am now. After injury prone teenage years, it's exhilirating when my body is capable of doing things I never imagined I would be able to do again.</p>
